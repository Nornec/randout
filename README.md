# randout
Random Workout Generator written in Ruby

Run it to get a random 4 section workout with an arbitrary Workout Difficulty Intex (WDI) based on the workouts that it chooses at random. All of these workouts can be done with simple household items or just your bodyweight.

Install Ruby and run the code as-is. You can modify the minimum_difficulty parameter to generate a harder or easier workout. The default is 0.
